<ul>
  <li>talking about inject/join/carrier stuff (sadly without Adrian who fell victim to US DST changes)
    <ul>
      <li>TL;DR: specific examples implemented for this stuff would be enormously useful ( hence opentracing/opentracing.github.io#79)</li>
      <li>some confusion about the DI aspects of Adrian’s concerns above (in Gitter)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>@michaelsembwever is going to work on the PR 11 in ot-java a bit
    <ul>
      <li>re log-builder in Java: mck says “first and foremost, just an RFC”; also, it doesn’t need to feel exactly like a “normal” logging API… can be more like an event-based API. The builder approach emphasizes that.</li>
      <li>another idea would be to add a notion / awareness of events as plumbing and various logging-style methods “on top”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>could be an argument to add a clean/porcelain API later since it’s easier to get wrong</li>
  <li>what would prevent someone from binding OT to Cassandra ~now… mck says “very little” (and sent a link above in Gitter).</li>
  <li>hoping to get some Docker code into their master branch next quarter</li>
  <li>Brandon’s Appdash change is almost in</li>
  <li>going to actually do this: opentracing/opentracing.github.io#78</li>
  <li>need to reach out to @kristofa the Brave maintainer to understand OT blockers</li>
</ul>
