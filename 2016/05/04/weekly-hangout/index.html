  </li>
  <li>@bensigelman to talk with colleagues releasing an OpenTracing .jar</li>
  <li>@bg451 was talking with the CTO of CoreOS; he was saying that a simple example app showing the benefits of tracing would make sense
    <ul>

      <li>Good to get Appdash-python set up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>@pritianka talked about OpenTracing blog and marketing materials
