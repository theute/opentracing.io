<p>Rough notes from our weekly hangout:</p>

<ul>
  <li>present: @adriancole @michaelsembwever @yurishkuro @adriancole</li>
  <li>general banter, etc, etc; notes not recorded for this part :)</li>
  <li>discussed @michaelsembwever’s work on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-10392
    <ul>
      <li>pretty neat: it basically creates an abstraction layer that makes distributed tracing within Cassandra pluggable</li>
      <li>mck has bound that abstraction layer to zipkin successfully, thus allowing organizations to integrate distributed traces between callers of Cassandra and the underlying Cassandra internals</li>
      <li>mck suggested that it would likely be possible to bind OT at that layer as well (and if not, that might indicate a design problem with OT)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>re opentracing/opentracing.github.io#70:
    <ul>
      <li>general consensus that Injector/Extractor and/or various registration mechanisms make sense for OT implementations, but nobody had any compelling use cases for keeping these concepts in the public OT API</li>
      <li>as such, general consensus that the simplified API (with fewer moving parts/layers) is probably a better path forward… @bensigelman will add a note on the github issue and give folks 48h to object before moving forward with that simplification</li>
      <li>see also @adriancole’s messages above ^^^ (which were from the meeting)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>status of the Java port more generally (https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java):
    <ul>
      <li>@michaelsembwever expects to polish up the existing PRs in the next day or so</li>
      <li>@bensigelman brought up the fact that we’d like to support Android as well as server-side Java
        <ul>
          <li>using Java 8 is a problem on that front</li>
          <li>unclear whether we will be able to have a single opentracing-java repo or if opentracing-android will have to get forked off (or maybe they would both depend on some core… hard to say at this point). TBD.</li>
          <li>there may be some special semantics for mobile client tracing instrumentation, too, which warrant inclusion at the OT layer (since there’s a unique end-user associated with every Span, for instance)… though perhaps those details can be handled by the Tracer implementations on Android.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>mck is hoping to give a talk in Vancouver about tracing in general and would like to discuss OpenTracing at same</li>
  <li>meta: we talked about creating a wiki, or maybe just having a less-formal area of the Jekyll site, or maybe having a blog (perhaps for things like these weekly notes)</li>
  <li>meta: we may move to alternating times for alternating weeks… that way at least 50% of the meetings will be convenient for everyone (rather than the current arrangement where 100% of the meetings are a little rough for both the Oceanic people and the NYC/Boston people)</li>
</ul>
