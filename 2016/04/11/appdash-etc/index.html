<p>We’ve been lazy about meeting notes lately (shame on @bensigelman) and, as such, we have overdue updates about a variety of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>@bg451 built an OpenTracing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code> for <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/appdash">Appdash</a>. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/appdash/tree/master/opentracing">the code</a>. Thanks to @slimsag for the review.</li>
  <li>@michaelsembwever sent out <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java/pull/25">an OpenTracing-Brave bridge PR</a> which @kristofa (<a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave">Brave</a> lead) is looking at</li>
  <li>@lookfwd sent out an <a href="https://github.com/lookfwd/opentracing-cpp/pull/1">C++ OpenTracing API PR</a> which has spawned a variety of other more fundamental discussions…
    <ul>
      <li>Of particular interest is the <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.github.io/issues/85">issue about unfinished spans and generalized causality DAG annotations</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
