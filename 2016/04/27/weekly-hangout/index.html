<p>Rough notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>@lookfwd has been looking at automake and autoconf
    <ul>
      <li>actual OT library was fine, but would be hard to use the lib without the above tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>@jmacd has been working on a C++ lib with a customer; they understand that a syntactic migration is likely down the line and are ok with that. As such, proceeding with an “OT in spirit” implementation and will merge with OT C++ proper in a few weeks.</li>
  <li>we talked about custom allocators</li>
  <li>@lookfwd will clean things up this weekend</li>
  <li>@jmacd to coordinate with @lookfwd</li>
  <li>@yurishkuro is continuing work on Java</li>
  <li>@bensigelman reports that @bcronin is learning about Maven Central Repo madness which will hopefully help with the OT-Java artifact as well</li>
  <li>@bensigelman to send something to the go-kit folks in the next week per https://github.com/go-kit/kit/issues/237</li>
</ul>
