<p>Dimitris (@lookfwd) joined us from London at 12:45am local time (!!!) to talk about <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.github.io/issues/85">opentracing.github.io/issues/85</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Rough notes (not in chronological order, and not complete):</p>

<ul>
  <li>@lookfwd wants spans to record in the underlying tracing system even before they’ve been finished. Everyone agreed that this was a reasonable thing to want in certain scenarios, though there is still the question of whether OT should have explicit methods to force per-span <code class="highlighter-rouge">flush()</code> or similar. For now we are going to leave this sort of detail purely in the API implementation.</li>
  <li>@lookfwd also wants to record the causal relationship between spans that do not overlap in time (e.g., perhaps a user request returns as soon as a single replica returns success, but as a developer it’s also important to trace the second/third/etc replica write success). Those on the hangout agreed that this was something OT should be able to represent. When we inject a span into a carrier, the carrier contents can be used as a “pointer” value from some other span… but where to record those pointers? <code class="highlighter-rouge">join</code>? <code class="highlighter-rouge">setTag</code>? Something else? People will make proposals on <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing.github.io/issues/85">opentracing.github.io/issues/85</a>.</li>
  <li>@bg451: basictracer getting close to being ready in python!</li>
  <li>span errors: we need to decide on how to represent them
    <ul>
      <li>could add a span method, use some standard span tag, or infer from a log record in an error state</li>
      <li>TL;DR: we will formalize a tag name+value (<code class="highlighter-rouge">"error": true</code>, most likely) for span errors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>cloud sleuth: @bensigelman to talk with Marcin about future plans</li>
</ul>
